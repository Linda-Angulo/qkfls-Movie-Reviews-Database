## ABOUT:

      Final Project: Scenario and Review Criteria
      Estimated time needed: 3 hours

      You now have the skills necessary to create and modify applications, connect cloud services, and configure CI/CD. You’re ready to take on the challenge of building your own IBM Cloudant connected, CI/CD enabled application.

In this scenario, you are a developer for a site that allows the general public to review movies, and then sorts the reviews into color categories, depending on their general tone. The developer who started the work has left the company without warning, and you have been engaged to complete the work.

The previous developer has developed the basic code for an application that allows the public to create movie reviews and stored it in GitHub. Your task is to refine the existing code and host the application on Cloud. You have chosen IBM Cloud and Cloud Foundry. Following cloud native best practices, you have decided to enable CI/CD to ensure any changes made in the future will be automatically deployed to the application.

To achieve this, you must fork the GitHub code to your own repo, and then create the required services in your IBM Cloud account and connect them to the application.

Negative movie reviews currently appear in orange. To test your CI/CD configuration, change the color of negative reviews to red, and verify that the change is updated to the application.
